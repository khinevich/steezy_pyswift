# Development History Files

This directory contains files that were created during the development and debugging process of the FastAPI backend.

## Files

### `debug_env.py`
- **Purpose**: Debugging script created to investigate environment variable loading issues
- **Created**: During troubleshooting of DATABASE_URL configuration
- **Status**: No longer needed (issue was resolved - database didn't exist, not env var problem)
- **Keep for**: Reference on how to debug environment variable loading

### `test_db_connection.py`
- **Purpose**: Testing script to verify PostgreSQL database connection and table creation
- **Created**: During initial PostgreSQL setup and debugging
- **Status**: Functionality now integrated into `startup.sh` script
- **Keep for**: Reference for manual database connection testing

## Note

These files are kept for historical reference and learning purposes. The functionality they provided has been integrated into the main development workflow through the `startup.sh` script.

For current development, use:
- `./startup.sh` - Complete environment setup and verification
- `./shutdown.sh` - Clean shutdown
- `./reset_db.sh` - Database management

See `SCRIPTS_README.md` in the parent directory for current development workflow.
